Unfortunately, our season's over, but we had a blast!

# Included in this project: 
1. OpenCV (in submodules for automatic updating: ```Core``` and ```Imgproc```). 
2. C++ build support (in ```FtcRobotController```).
3. PID controllers (```PIDController``` and ```PIDConstants```).  
4. Multithreading with AsyncTask instances (```SimpleTask```, ```ComplexTask```) from [other repo]( https://github.com/Makiah/makiahsandroidlib).  
5. On-screen logging (```LoggingBase.instance```).  
6. Music players (```Tunes.play()```). 
7. Modular robot components (```new Robot()```).  
8. Dynamic Vuforia and OpenCV swapping (```OpenCVCam cam = new OpenCVCam(); cam.start(listener);``` and ```VuforiaCam cam = new VuforiaCam(); cam.start();```).  
9. Cryptobox position tracker, Jewel, and (planned) Glyph detectors (optimized for our bot though).
